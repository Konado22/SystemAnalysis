Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The Driverpass project was a vision of a training platform for student drivers to help prepare them for drving tests. The application would provide dmv approvded traning material and practice tests as well as the ability to schedule lessons with instrutors to help succeed.
  
What did you do particularly well?

  I felt that I grasped the requriements of the project very well and was able to provide all significant deliverables for bussiness and technical requirements. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would probably redo some of the technical requirements of the bussiness design document to be slightly more specific and incoperate more standard technical requirements.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  UI implementation was showcased and provides a very user-friendly interface. Proccess modeling was also significant to help describe and show the routing and descision making that wiil need to be implemented in the software. Considerting user needs when designing an application is crucial as it is instrumental to attract and retain customers, friendly user enviornmnets tend to help with both of these.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I like to have an understanding of some of the requirements prior to development, such as what classes need to be created and how they interact within the system. Knowinig what attributes and methods are needed in those classes make developing website functionality
